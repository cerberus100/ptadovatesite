## üí° STRATEGIC IMPACT
The slogan 'Empowering Patients with Choice' perfectly aligns with:
- Diabetic wound care positioning (multiple treatment options)

- Differentiation from competitors (choice vs. prescription)

This creates a consistent brand narrative where every service revolves around expanding patient choices rather than dictating solutions.
